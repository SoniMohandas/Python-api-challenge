# WeatherPy
Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

# Scatter plots of the following relationship
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# linear regression on each relationship
Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# VacationPy
Heat map created that displays the humidity for every city created in WeatherPY.
Narrowed DataFrame to find ideal weather conditions such as: max temperature lower than 72 degrees but higher than 65 degrees, wind speed less than 5 mph and zero cloudiness.
