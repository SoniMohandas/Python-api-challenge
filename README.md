# WeatherPy
Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

# Scatter plots of the following relationship
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude, 
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude, 
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude, 
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude, 

# linear regression on each relationship
Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude, 
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude, 
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude, 
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude, 
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude, 
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude, 
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude, 
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude, 

# VacationPy
Heat map created that displays the humidity for every city created in WeatherPY.

Narrowed DataFrame to find ideal weather conditions for the vacation visit, max temperature lower than 72 degrees but higher than 65 degrees, wind speed less than 5 mph and zero cloudiness.  Six cities filtered and pinned in the heatmap with hotels nearest to 5000 meters.
